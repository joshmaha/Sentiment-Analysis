# ðŸŽ¬ Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews

This project implements a sentiment analysis model that classifies movie reviews as **positive** or **negative** using a vectorization approach. 

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The project consists of:

- **Text preprocessing** using tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization
- **Vectorization** using TF-IDF to convert text into numerical features
- **Model training** using Logistic Regression
- **Review testing** using a separate dataset of 1,000 reviews from a forked repo

The trained model can classify unseen movie reviews into positive or negative sentiment with reasonably high accuracy.

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

### Preprocessing

1. Lowercases and removes punctuation
2. Tokenizes text into words
3. Removes stopwords (e.g., "the", "and")
4. Lemmatizes remaining words (e.g., "running" â†’ "run")

### Training (`calcSentiment_train`)
- Loads a labeled `.json` training file
- Applies preprocessing
- Vectorizes the data using `TfidfVectorizer`
- Trains a `LogisticRegression` model
- Saves both the model and vectorizer to disk

### Testing (`calcSentiment_test`)
- Loads trained model and vectorizer
- Preprocesses a single review
- Predicts the sentiment (returns `True` for positive, `False` for negative)

## ðŸ§ª Dataset

For evaluation, 1,000 movie reviews from the [nas5w/imdb-data](https://github.com/nas5w/imdb-data) repository were used. These reviews were extracted from a JSON file and tested using the model developed in this project.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jnmaharaj/AI-and-ML.git
cd AI-and-ML
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Train the model:
```python
from sentiment_analysis import calcSentiment_train
calcSentiment_train("train.json")
```

4. Test a single review:
```python
from sentiment_analysis import calcSentiment_test
print(calcSentiment_test("This movie was absolutely wonderful!"))
```
